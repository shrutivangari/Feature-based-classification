# Feature based classification of product reviews
With the advent of technology in this era, manufacturing companies have been changing the product features depending on the customer requirements from time to time. The customer reviews of these products also changed with the features proportionately. Hence product reviews based on the increasing features became an integral part of a product’s success. In this paper, we have considered the customer reviews from amazon for two products Nokia 6610 (released in 2004) and Nokia 6600 (released in 2009). We have applied techniques from data mining and conclusions are drawn after comparing the results from 2 tools – ROSE2 & WEKA.
